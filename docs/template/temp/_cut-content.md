Additionally, @rx-angular/template provides some neat optimization tools such as
[unpatch](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular/tree/master/libs/template/docs/unpatch.md) or
[viewport-prio](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular/tree/master/libs/template/docs/viewport-prio.md) which in general will give you more control

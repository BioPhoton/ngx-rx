# RxAngular

RxAngular offers a comprehensive toolset for handling fully reactive Angular applications with the main focus on runtime
performance and template rendering.

RxAngular is divided into two initially independent packages:

- [ðŸ“¦@rx-angular/template](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular/tree/master/libs/template/README.md)
- [ðŸ“¦@rx-angular/state](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx-angular/tree/master/libs/state/README.md)

Used together, you get a powerful tool for developing high-performance angular applications with or without NgZone.

## @rx-angular/template

[![rx-angular](https://circleci.com/gh/BioPhoton/rx-angular.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/BioPhoton/rx-angular)

A comprehensive toolset for fully reactive rendering in Angular.
It leverages the latest Browser APIs (while still being backwards compatible) to maximize the rendering performance and thus
the user experience of your angular application.
The functionalities are provided by
structural directives, pipes, RxJS operators, or imperative functions to manage the rendering in Angular.

## Key features

- Optimized rendering performance
- Configurable change detection strategies
- Works in zone-full as well as zone-less applications

## @rx-angular/state

# Motivation

coercion, or to be more specific type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another. 
This can be done with any primitive value in JavaScript. e.g. number, string, Symbol, boolean, null, undefined

In practice you can apply this technique in 2 ways:
- explicitly e.g. `Number(string)` coercres a string to a number
- implicitely e.g. `!!string` coerces a string to a boolean

In general when we apply those techniques our code base starts to maintain repetative patterns which either bloten up the codebase or just makes it harder to read.

As a good example let's look at this snippet of code here:

```typescript
const num = !isNaN(parseFloat(valueFromInput)) && !isNaN(Number(valueFromInput));
```

Because we receive the value from an input the type is always string. We have to care every time the when we want to pass the value to get a propper number type of it.

Furthermore, in version 10 of Angular the team announced strict type checking as opt-in configuration. 
Since then developers where encurraged to match exaclty the types. This especially needs attention when it comes to templates.

For this very reason the team later on shipped a sub package under the Angular CDK to provide some helpers for the important cases.
The included helpers can be used whenever coercion is needed to obtain a propper value.

RxAngular also spotted a often used way of cosercing. 
When triing out the different reactive architectures we realized for a nice to use mix of reactive and imperative programming we needed to accept statis values as well as Observables on many places.

A common scenario would be to pass an Observable as input binding of components or directives to bypass changes from change detection.

```typescript
@Component({
  // ...
})
export class AppComponent {
  
  prop1$: Observable<number>;
  
  @Input()
  set prop1(val: Observable<number> | number) {
      this.prop1$ = isObservable(val) ? val : of(val);
  }
  
}
```

**The Benefits of RxAngular**

- ✅ coercion helper for Observables
- ✅ RxJS operators 
- ✅ RxJS factories
- ✅ Fully tested 
- ✅ Well Documented


# RxAngular coercion helpers

**Factories:**
- coerceObservable
- coerceDistinctObservable
- coerceAllFactory

**Operators:**
- coerceObservableWith
- coerceDistinctWith

In the section usage we will go into more detail.

## Setup

The coalescing features can be used directly from the `cdk` package or indirectly through the `template` package.
To do so, install the `cdk` package and, if needed, the packages depending on it:

1. Install `@rx-angular/cdk`

```bash
npm i @rx-angular/cdk
// or
yarn add @rx-angular/cdk
```

## Usage

```typescript
@Component({
  // ...
})
export class AppComponent {
  
  prop1$: Observable<number>;
  
  @Input()
  set prop1(val: Observable<number> | number) {
      this.prop1$ = coerceObservable(val);
  }
  
}
```



```typescript
@Component({
  // ...
})
export class AppComponent {
  
  _prop1 = new Subject<number | Observable<number>>();
  prop1$: Observable<number> = this._prop1.pipe(
    coerceObservableWith()
  ); 
 
  @Input()
  set prop1(val: Observable<number> | number) {
      this._prop1.next(val);
  }
  
}
```
